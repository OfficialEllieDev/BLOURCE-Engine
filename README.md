# BLOURCE-Engine
A Roblox Game engine based on Sourceâ„¢.

This is the official Blource Engine GitHub, originally meant for issues.

The Dev Kit is not out yet, but will be included soon as the original AP400 game
cames out.

The AP400 Playtesting will come out way later, when the Demo will be half-done.
Having access to AP400 early also means having access to the Blource Engine.
